This week, 3 of us report from a different part of Virginia, part under the ground. Not knowing what to expect, sir Schwartz, Hidden Collins, and I traveled to a cave on a farm in nearby Highland County. There, we met with people who study and explore caves. A woman from a farm restricts access to keep it as undisturbed and pure as possible. So I cannot name the cake, but I can say that there's just been no more logs than a hole in the ground. In fact, that is essentially what our Virginia caves are. Above ground, they first appear as sinkholes. Underground cave is exposed when water in the sinkholes are roads, the underlying liner. Our guide, doctor Morris Newman from the state college made us aware that the cave is more than just a hole on the ground. As I entered the cave, I felt like I was I felt as if I was walking. I was just totally disconnected from the well above. Mister Newman explained that an important relationship exists between the well above and the ground below. He told us that the water that he told us the water that created the cave runs into an underground reservoir that serves as the source of our drinking water, so the cave must be protected. As our tour continued, doctor Newman reminded us to not disturb or be damaging to the cave environment. When we learned that the farmer unsoaked The lake takes special care with the ground around the cave undisturbed even putting a gate across the entrance. Without this protection without this protection, it's becoming trash or other pollutants could enter the local water supply. Scientists have used nontoxic diet to treat health pollution travels through caves and into our water. In truth, case the vital components to the ecosystem of the surrounding area. For example, we saw thousands of bats, including some endangered Virginia big airbags. They spent their days hanging upside down and moved for a cave. But at dusk, they fly out to eat insects. What's the cave creatures from the base to the albino fish in the streams and the insects living under the rock? Obtain their food from the world above. These cave dwellers made the suit just as much as we need the water underground. Emerging from a cave just an hour or so before that, We were uniformly covered in dust. As we brushed off the dust and looked at it, we realized we had experienced something extraordinary. We were looking back to Virginia, but the ground did not look the same to us. It now looks like the top of picture. The part of this theme still didn't sit well. To be at the case, that was a very quick, but the invitation to visit came with clear response. In doctor Newman's words, respect and care for the world wherever you are. Laws protecting caves and water supply. But just holding the chart. So we need to look at laws. So the first one, How many communities access their water supply from underground caves? So it talks about caves and water and about, you know, the supply, but It doesn't talk about loss at all, but penalties are charged to landowners who fail to protect water in the cave. I think that's what it What are the primary dangers close to the water supply by presence of caves? No. What if so b is the only one that talks about law. So that's the one it is because it needs to be about the laws."
